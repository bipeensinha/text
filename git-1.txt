Branching in GIT
=====================
We can create multiple branches to parallely work on different part of the development project
Eg developer can create a branch for weappdev and mob_appdev
parallely he can create code on these branches for those modules
After creating the code seperately he can merge with the main branch

To find the list of branches available
git branch
To find the list of all branches(remote as well as local)
git branch -a
To create a branch
git branch branchname
To switch into a branch
git checkout branchname
To delete a branch
git branch -d branchname
To delete a remote branch
git branch -dr branchname

Note:By default git performs its activities on the master branch


Downloading the repository from git
======================================
It can be done in 3 ways
git clone
git fetch
git pull

git clone will download the complete repository into any folder and also this folder is initilized as git repositoty
Syntax: git clone git_repo_url
 To get the above url 
open github.com
login into you account
click on repositories tab
click on the reposity that we should download
click on "clone or download" button
copy the url
use it with the above command

git fetch will downlaod only the recent changes and store them on a seperate branch..to view these changes we can switch into that branch

1 git branch -a : this will list all branches local and remote
2 git checkout remote_branchname
3 view the changes that we performed in github
5 to merge this branch with master branch
  checkout on the master branch
  
   git checkout master
   git merge remote_branchname

git pull will downlaod the changes but it will automatically merge
with the master branch
